### Background

Establish an open-sourced network-based simulation platform for shared mobility operations. The simulation explicitly characterizes drivers’ movements on road networks for trip delivery, idle cruising, and en-route pick-up. 


### Contributions

• We develop a comprehensive, multi-functional and open-sourced simulator for ride-sourcing service, which can be used by both researchers and industrial practitioners on a variety of operational tasks. The proposed simulation platform overcomes a few challenges faced by previous simulators, including the closeness to reality, representation of customers’ and drivers’ heterogeneous behaviors, generalization for different tasks. 

• The simulator provide interfaces for the training and testing of different tasks, such as testing of optimization algorithms, training/testing of reinforcement learning based approaches for matching and repositioning, evaluations of economic models for equilibrium analysis and operational strategy designs. 

• Based on a vehicle utilization based validation task, some RL based experiments, and one task for theoretical model evaluation, the simulator is validated to be effective and efficient for ride-sourcing related researches. In the future, the simulator can be easily modified for completing other tasks, such as dynamic pricing, ride-pooling service operations, control of shared autonomous vehicles, etc.

##### Data preparing

There are three files in 'input' directory. You can use the driver data and order data provided by us. Also, you can run `python handle_raw_data.py`  to generate orders' information, run `python driver_generation.py`  to generate drviers' information.  

In [config.py](https://github.com/HKU-Smart-Mobility-Lab/Transpotation_Simulator/blob/main/simulator/config.py), you can set the parameters of the simulator.

```python
't_initial' # start time of the simulation (s)
't_end'  # end time of the simulation (s)
'delta_t' # interval of the simulation (s) 
'vehicle_speed' # speed of vehicle (km / h)
'repo_speed'  # speed of reposition
'order_sample_ratio' # ratio of order sampling
'order_generation_mode'  # the mode of order generation
'driver_sample_ratio' : 1, # ratio of driver sampling
'maximum_wait_time_mean' : 300, # mean value of maximum waiting time
'maximum_wait_time_std' : 0, # variance of maximum waiting time
"maximum_pickup_time_passenger_can_tolerate_mean":float('inf'),  # s
"maximum_pickup_time_passenger_can_tolerate_std"
"maximum_price_passenger_can_tolerate_mean"
"maximum_price_passenger_can_tolerate_std"
'maximal_pickup_distance'  # km
'request_interval': 5,  #
'cruise_flag' :False, # 
'delivery_mode':'rg',
'pickup_mode':'rg',
'max_idle_time' : 1,
'cruise_mode': 'random',
'reposition_flag': False,
'eligible_time_for_reposition' : 10, # s
'reposition_mode': '',
'track_recording_flag' : True,
'driver_far_matching_cancel_prob_file' : 'driver_far_matching_cancel_prob',

```

##### Real Road Network Module

We use [osmnx](https://pypi.org/project/osmnx/) to acquire the shortest path from the real world. You can set 'north_lat', 'south_lat', 'east_lng' and 'west_lng' in [config.py](https://github.com/HKU-Smart-Mobility-Lab/Transpotation_Simulator/blob/main/simulator/config.py) , and you can get road network for the specified region.

##### Mongodb Module

If your road network is huge, yu can use mongodb to store the road network information and add index on node id which uniquely identifies a node on the road network.
You can use the following code to connect your local database route_network and collection route_list which stores the information. After that, you can use find_one interface to achieve the shortest path list easily. 
```python
myclient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = myclient["route_network"]
mycollect = mydb['route_list']

re_data = {
            'node': str(ori_id) + str(dest_id)
        }
re = mycollect.find_one(re_data)
```


##### Price Module

You can set the maximum order price that is normally distributed and acceptable to passengers by modifing `maximum_price_passenger_can_tolerate_mean'` and `maximum_price_passenger_can_tolerate_std`.

##### Cruising and Repositioning Module



##### Dispatching Module

In dispatch_alg.py, we implement the function LD, we use binary map matching algorithm to dispatch orders.

##### Experiment

You can modify the parameters in [config.py](https://github.com/HKU-Smart-Mobility-Lab/Transpotation_Simulator/blob/main/simulator/config.py), and then excute `python main.py`. The records will be recorded in the directory named output.
