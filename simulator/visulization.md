We here share with you a demo video of the visualization resulting from our simulator. Our simulator is based on the real road network of Hong Kong and massive actual taxi mobility data. We believe that this video will be of interest to you and provide valuable insights into our research.

Please note that due to the video size limitation of GitHub, we are only able to provide a compressed version of the video. As a result, the quality of the video may not be as clear as we would like it to be.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about our research, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would be more than happy to discuss our findings with you.
